## Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition using TensorFlow and OpenCV

Hand gesture recognition is a rapidly evolving field within Human-Computer Interaction technology, with applications spanning virtual environment control, sign language translation, robot control, and even music creation. In this machine learning project, we'll develop a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the MediaPipe framework in conjunction with TensorFlow and OpenCV in Python.

## What is MediaPipe? 
MediaPipe is an open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Google, designed for customizable machine learning solutions. It's lightweight and includes several pre-trained models for tasks such as face detection, pose estimation, hand recognition, and object detection.

## What is TensorFlow? 
TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google's Brain Team for machine learning and deep learning. It supports a wide range of tasks, with a particular emphasis on deep neural networks.

Neural networks, or artificial neural networks, are a subset of machine learning and form the core of deep learning algorithms. Inspired by the human brain, these networks mimic the way biological neurons communicate. They consist of node layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
